1. **Open-source** — Has a clear license (MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, etc.)
2. **Documented** — Has a README with installation and usage instructions
3. **Relevant** — Clearly applicable to neuroimaging (MRI, fMRI, EEG/MEG, diffusion)
4. **Maintained** — Active development or stable release (mark `[Stale]` if no updates >2 years)

## How to Add a Tool

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your tool to the appropriate section in `README.md`
3. Use the following format:

```

4. Submit a Pull Request with:
   - Clear title: `Add ToolName`
   - Brief description of what the tool does
   - Why it belongs in this list

## Format Guidelines

- **One tool per row**
- **Description**: 1 sentence, focus on what it does for neuroimaging
- **Scenario**: Use existing categories (preprocessing, segmentation, classification, reconstruction, etc.)
- **Links**: Include paper link if published
- **No star counts** — they become outdated quickly
